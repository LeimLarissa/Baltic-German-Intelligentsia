# Baltic-German Intelligentsia

Here I collect everything for a possible database of Baltic-German educated people from the turn of the 19th century.  
This is more or less my sandbox to test and improve my skills.  
The idea for this project developed during my Master Studies, but now this is just a side project on a topic I'm interested in.
